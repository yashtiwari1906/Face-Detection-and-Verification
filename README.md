# Face-Detection-and-Verification
In this we are using S3FD for detection of faces and inception resnet v1 for generating a 512 dimensional embedding which will be further used for verification.
Here we are taking a small video clip from the TV series named Big Bang Theory in which we are trying to locate seven of its characters namely- Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj, Penny, Amy, Bernadette, Emily and Stuart. If any of the other face will come in detection it will be simply shown by the unknown.
One example for detection is shown below-

This is how it is applied in videos some where it is lacking but by setting threshold value and using more character specific image for forming data base may improve the performance.
